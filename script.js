// initialize array of 'choices': rock, paper, scissor
// use a prompt so user can enter "rock", "paper", or "scissor"
// computer chooses a random value from the array of 'choices
// in order to determine if the user wins or not:
// initialize "wins", "losses", "ties" variables
// the following will be created using a combination of if/else, switch cases, or for loops:
// if user picks rock and computer picks scissors, then user wins
// if user picks rock and computer picks paper, then user losses
// if user picks scissor and computer picks paper, then user wins
// if user picks scissor and computer picks rock, then user losses
// if user picks paper and computer picks rock, then user wins
// if user picks paper and computer picks scissor, then user losses
// if user and computer pick same thing, then it is a tie
// prompt user to play again
